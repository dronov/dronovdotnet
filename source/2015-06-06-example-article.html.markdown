Hello! My name is Mike.

I created this blog in 2010. It has been a long trip because the content was changing with according my interests. I wrote about some social staff, robotics, news, articles connected with something... But some things are the same.

Now it will be a resource with stuff about interests which have never changed: Programming, Linux and stuff connected or similar with it. I can call myself like a computer geek, and I have friends with similar interests.

I'm not sure that it will be tons of materials only in English. My native language is Russian so I think I will be able to set internationaliation setting for articles.
