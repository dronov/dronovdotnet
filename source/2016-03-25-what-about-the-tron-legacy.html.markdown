Owwh. Would you remember the great story about Kevin Flynn? It was released at
1982 and was one of the first technological movies with 3D graphics in the s
world. Huh, I was not born when these times had happened.

  *Tron: Legacy* was released at the end of 2010 year. It also was a very
technological movie competing with the first Avatar. But I remembered this
movie not only for that.

I was at the premiere with my close friend.
It was the first and the last time when I see all people in the cinema had got
up and applauded.
