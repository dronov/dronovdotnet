Hi there! 

We have a first cloud oscilloscope update. 

Recently we've improved qt program on orange pi, now we can handle and show correct signal on display   .

A little demonstration using oscilloscope to get signal from the sound at youtube:

Right now we're continuyng work on qt program, debugging, etc. We made a stable job of oscilloscope for over 11 minutes without lockups :D We know that the problem
located with our program and if fails with *zone_watermark_ok* error. 

We participate in Eclipse OPEN IoT Challenge, and this post is another addition to our proposal.
