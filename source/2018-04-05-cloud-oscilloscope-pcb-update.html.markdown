Hello!

At the [build instructions](https://hackaday.io/project/90259/instructions) you can find a PCB for printing. Andrey works on a handmade PCB with Heat transfer printing method. It is almost done and ready to include in the cloud oscilloscope. I've asked him to take the soldering iron and make a feel that he's working hard on the photo :)
